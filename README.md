# dotfiles

Collection of dotfiles for versioning and use across deployment contexts.

Files in the root of the directory are symbolically linked to corresponding files in ~/

Note, to symbolically link a file, you must do ln -s ~/projects/dotfiles/.file ~/.file, i.e., the paths must be absolute paths (use of the ~ shortcut is OK). See [How to properly store dotfiles with git](http://superuser.com/questions/302312/how-to-properly-store-dotfiles-in-a-centralized-git-repository).
